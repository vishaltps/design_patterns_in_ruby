The Factory Pattern in Ruby is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It is useful when you want to abstract the object creation process, making it more flexible and independent of the client code that uses these objects.

Here's how you can implement the Factory Pattern in Ruby:

1. Define a factory interface or an abstract class that declares a method for creating objects. This method is often named `create` or similar.

2. Create concrete factory classes that implement the factory interface and provide specific implementations for creating objects of different types.

3. Create concrete product classes that represent the objects you want to create. These product classes should not depend on the client code and can be instantiated by factory methods.

4. Use the factory to create objects rather than using `new` directly, allowing you to switch between different product implementations without modifying the client code.

Here's an example of the Factory Pattern in Ruby:

```ruby
# Step 1: Define the factory interface
class AnimalFactory
  def create_animal
    raise NotImplementedError, "Subclasses must implement this method"
  end
end

# Step 2: Create concrete factory classes
class DogFactory < AnimalFactory
  def create_animal
    Dog.new
  end
end

class CatFactory < AnimalFactory
  def create_animal
    Cat.new
  end
end

# Step 3: Create concrete product classes
class Dog
  def speak
    "Woof!"
  end
end

class Cat
  def speak
    "Meow!"
  end
end

# Step 4: Use the factory to create objects
def get_animal(factory)
  animal = factory.create_animal
  puts "The #{animal.class} says: #{animal.speak}"
end

dog_factory = DogFactory.new
cat_factory = CatFactory.new

get_animal(dog_factory) # Output: The Dog says: Woof!
get_animal(cat_factory) # Output: The Cat says: Meow!
```

In this example, we have an `AnimalFactory` interface with a `create_animal` method. We then create concrete factory classes, `DogFactory` and `CatFactory`, which implement this method to create specific animal objects.

The client code (`get_animal`) uses the factory to create animals without knowing the specific implementation details of how each animal is created. This decouples the client code from the concrete product classes and allows for easy extension by adding new factories or products.
