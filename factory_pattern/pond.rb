# Imagine that you are asked to build a simulation of life in a pond that has plenty of ducks:


class Pond
  def initialize(number_ducks)
    @ducks = number_ducks.times.inject([]) do |ducks, i|
      ducks << Duck.new("Duck#{i}")
      ducks
    end
  end

  def simulate_one_day
    @ducks.each {|duck| duck.speak}
    @ducks.each {|duck| duck.eat}
    @ducks.each {|duck| duck.sleep}
  end
end

pond = Pond.new(3)
pond.simulate_one_day


# But how would we model our Pond if we wanted to have frogs instead of ducks? In the implementation above, we are specifying in the Pond's initializer that it should be filled up with ducks. So, we'll refactor it so that the decision of creating one type of animal or another is made in a subclass:

class Pond
  def initialize(number_animals)
    @animals = number_animals.times.inject([]) do |animals, i|
      animals << new_animal("Animal#{i}")
      animals
    end
  end

  def simulate_one_day
    @animals.each {|animal| animal.speak}
    @animals.each {|animal| animal.eat}
    @animals.each {|animal| animal.sleep}
  end
end

class FrogPond < Pond
  def new_animal(name)
    Frog.new(name)
  end
end

pond = FrogPond.new(3)
pond.simulate_one_day
