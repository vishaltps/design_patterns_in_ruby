The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. It allows you to create an object step by step and produce different representations of the same object. In Ruby, you can implement the Builder pattern using various techniques, but one common approach is to use a combination of classes and method chaining.

Here's a simple example of how to implement the Builder pattern in Ruby:

```ruby
# Product class representing the object to be constructed
class Product
  attr_accessor :part_a, :part_b, :part_c

  def initialize
    @part_a = nil
    @part_b = nil
    @part_c = nil
  end

  def describe
    "Part A: #{@part_a}, Part B: #{@part_b}, Part C: #{@part_c}"
  end
end

# Builder class responsible for constructing the product
class ProductBuilder
  def initialize
    @product = Product.new
  end

  def build_part_a(value)
    @product.part_a = value
    self
  end

  def build_part_b(value)
    @product.part_b = value
    self
  end

  def build_part_c(value)
    @product.part_c = value
    self
  end

  def get_product
    @product
  end
end

# Client code that uses the builder to construct a product
builder = ProductBuilder.new
product = builder
  .build_part_a("A1")
  .build_part_b("B2")
  .build_part_c("C3")
  .get_product

puts product.describe
```

In this example:

- `Product` represents the complex object you want to construct.
- `ProductBuilder` is responsible for constructing the `Product`. It provides methods like `build_part_a`, `build_part_b`, and `build_part_c` to set the various parts of the `Product`. These methods return the builder itself, allowing you to chain them together.
- The client code creates a `ProductBuilder` instance and uses method chaining to set the parts of the product. Finally, it retrieves the fully constructed `Product`.

The Builder pattern helps create complex objects with multiple components in a flexible and readable way, allowing you to vary the construction process and produce different representations of the same object if needed.
