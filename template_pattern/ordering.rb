The Template Method Pattern in Ruby is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, allowing sub-classes to alter specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. It promotes code reusability and is often used for defining a common algorithm structure in a base class, with specific steps or behaviors left to be implemented by concrete subclasses.

Here's how you can implement the Template Method Pattern in Ruby:

1. Create an abstract base class (or module) that defines the template method. This class provides a set of methods that make up the algorithm and often includes some abstract methods or hooks that should be implemented by subclasses.

2. Define concrete subclasses that inherit from the base class and implement the abstract methods or hooks to provide their own custom behavior.

3. The template method in the base class orchestrates the algorithm by calling the various methods, including the abstract ones, in a specific order.

4. Clients use the concrete subclasses to customize and execute the algorithm according to their specific requirements.

Here's an example of the Template Method Pattern in Ruby:

```ruby
# Step 1: Create an abstract base class with a template method
class OrderProcessing
  def process_order
    select_items
    calculate_total
    apply_discount
    payment
    send_confirmation_email
  end

  # Abstract methods (to be implemented by subclasses)
  def select_items
    raise NotImplementedError, "Subclasses must implement select_items"
  end

  def calculate_total
    raise NotImplementedError, "Subclasses must implement calculate_total"
  end

  def apply_discount
    # Default behavior (no discount)
  end

  def payment
    raise NotImplementedError, "Subclasses must implement payment"
  end

  def send_confirmation_email
    puts "Order confirmation email sent."
  end
end

# Step 2: Create concrete subclasses and implement abstract methods
class OnlineOrder < OrderProcessing
  def select_items
    puts "Selecting items from the online catalog."
  end

  def calculate_total
    puts "Calculating total for online order."
  end

  def payment
    puts "Processing online payment."
  end
end

class InStoreOrder < OrderProcessing
  def select_items
    puts "Selecting items from the physical store."
  end

  def calculate_total
    puts "Calculating total for in-store order."
  end

  def apply_discount
    puts "Applying in-store discount."
  end

  def payment
    puts "Accepting payment at the store."
  end
end

# Step 3 and 4: Use the concrete subclasses
online_order = OnlineOrder.new
online_order.process_order

puts "\n"

in_store_order = InStoreOrder.new
in_store_order.process_order
```

In this example, we have an abstract base class `OrderProcessing` that defines the template method `process_order` and includes abstract methods that should be implemented by concrete subclasses. Concrete subclasses `OnlineOrder` and `InStoreOrder` provide their own implementations of the abstract methods.

The template method `process_order` in the base class orchestrates the order processing algorithm, including selecting items, calculating the total, applying discounts, processing payment, and sending a confirmation email. Subclasses customize the behavior by implementing the abstract methods.

When `process_order` is called on instances of concrete subclasses, it follows the algorithm defined in the base class but with specific steps customized for online and in-store orders.
